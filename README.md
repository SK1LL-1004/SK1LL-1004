- 👋 Hi, I’m @SK1LL-1004
- 👀 I’m interested in the programming and creation of modalities in games, in order to live with others with the same tastes and be a community.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to program in C #, C ++ and network subnetting.
- 💞️ I am not looking to collaborate anywhere at the moment, as I am focused on creating a new definitive community.
